We made change to old behavior where as this action menu will be displayed on "Click" instead of "Hover" by default and it stays until user clicks outside or performs any other operation on the page. But if user would like to enable menu on "hover", they can do by this overriding this option "rb.newui.options.listView.showColumnActionMenuOnHover=true"</p>

                <p><strong>25355/00330325/00331044&#160;</strong>Tenant not receiving welcome mail to login<br />Another bug affecting application installation on new and existing tenants caused a new tenant to not receive a welcome mail.</p>
                <p><strong>25087/00329226&#160;</strong>Application imported from tenant does not show up after restart of Tomcat<br />After importing an application XML into a tenant, and then restarting Tomcat makes the application disappear from the list of applications in the tenant.&#160; This also occurred if the application is installed via the MarketPlace.</p>
                <p><strong>24929/00329218&#160;</strong>Progress <MadCap:variable name="IB.ProductName" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> video still visible after “Quick Create”-ing an application &#160;<br />The video link was hardcoded in the qcOverview.jsp.

                <p><strong>24909/&#160;</strong><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://community.progress.com/community_groups/rollbase/f/25/p/21282/74760#74760">https://community.progress.com/community_groups/rollbase/f/25/p/21282/74760#74760</a>&#160;</strong>&#160;<br />Workflow Actions in Group By view are not showing up &#160;</p>
                <p><strong>24799/00328713&#160;</strong>Updating an app with the same XML throws warning message&#160;<br />Whenever we install an application, if the application has deleted certain components like views/pages/fields etc. which are already present in the tenant zone, they are not shown as deleted components.</p>
                <p>We only tend to check for deleted components when the application is already installed and is being updated. This is creating confusion in this case as it seems to look like updating an app is trying to delete some components in the tenant even when no change has been done to the app being imported.</p>
                <p>The logic now shows the deleted components even when the app is being installed.</p>

This behavior change will resolve the issue wherein users were unable to submit form without changing field value that had failed server-side validation&#160;</p>
